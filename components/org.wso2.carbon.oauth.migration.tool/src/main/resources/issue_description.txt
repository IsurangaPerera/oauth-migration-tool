----------
When two federated users with similar usernames try to get an access token or an authorization
code in an environment where multiple federated IDPs are configured the token/code will be shared
between both users based on which user creates the access token 1st.This issue has already been
resolved in Identity Server 5.8.0.

Even Though you are affected by this vulnerability, as active
tokens/codes issued for federated users before the migration expires users will be completely
safe from this vulnerability. However we recommend to use tool to revoke all affected tokens
and authorization codes to ensure highest security.
